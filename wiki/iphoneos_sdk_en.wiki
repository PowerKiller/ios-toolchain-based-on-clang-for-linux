===1. Extract iPhoneSDk pkg from xcode-xxx.img===
Mount the xcode img from apple under MacOSX, usually it under */Volumes/Xcode*, find *iPhoneSDK5_0.pkg*  for ios 5 or other versions according to your iOS version.

===2. Extract files  for iPhoneOS SDK===

{{{
cd /usr/share
xar -xf iPhoneSDK5_0.pkg Payload; cat Payload | zcat | cpio -id
mv Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS5.0.sdk .
rm -rf Platforms
rm -rf Payload
}}}

===3. ARC support===
If you want arc support via *'clang -fobjc-arc'*,  you need add *libarclite_iphoneos.a* to sdk. it is extracted from Xcode.

Download it from here: http://ios-toolchain-based-on-clang-for-linux.googlecode.com/files/libarclite_iphoneos.a.tar.gz

{{{
mkdir -p /usr/share/iPhone5.0.sdk/usr/lib/arc
tar zxvf libarclite_iphoneos.a.tar.gz -C /usr/share/iPhone5.0.sdk/usr/lib/arc
}}}
