=iOS toolchain based on clang for linux=

<font color="blue">Cjacker <cjacker@gmail.com> 2012-11-26 </font>

Clang for linux provides an almost full implementation for Objective C 2.0 includes blocks and other features gcc doesn't supported.

Here is an tutorial of  'How to setup iOS toolchain based on clang for linux'.

Actually, the iOS toolchain under linux is as same and simple as other crosscompile toolchain for embeded devices. It should include these components:

  # *Assembler and Linker*: cctools and ld64 from opendarwin.
  # *Compiler*: here we use llvm/clang.
  # *SDK*, include headers and libraries.
  # *Utilities*: such as ldid codesign tool.

You also need an iOS device jailbreaked and with ssh installed.

By the way, the default ssh password is <font color="red"> *alpine* </font>.

Before we start, you need a workable C/C++ compiler installed.



==<font color="blue"> Step 1 : The compiler </font>==

Clang/llvm 3.3 svn is *strongly* recommended.

Please refer to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ios-toolchain-based-on-clang-for-linux/wiki/build_clang_en"> this link</a> and build a svn version for your linux distribution.

If your distribution already provides  clang/llvm packagesï¼Œmake sure it is 3.1 release or above.  Lower version may also work but is not tested. 


==<font color="blue"> Step 2 : The assembler and linker </font>==
I had ported cctools-836 and ld64-128.2 from opendarwin to linux. the porting process is a little bit complicated, let's just skip it.

Here is the final tarball:

http://ios-toolchain-based-on-clang-for-linux.googlecode.com/files/cctools-836.10-ld64-128.2-for-linux.tar.gz

Download and build it: 

LDFLAGS points to the path contains libLTO.so, change it according to your clang/llvm configurations.

<font color="red">*NOTE*
  # make sure clang/llvm is installed and works. clang will be used as a compiler.

  # make sure libobjc2 is installed from http://download.gna.org/gnustep/libobjc2-1.6.1.tar.bz2.
</font>



{{{
$export CC=clang
$export CXX=clang++
$export CFLAGS=-fno-stack-protector
$export CXXFLAGS=-fno-stack-protector
$LDFLAGS+=/usr/lib/llvm ./configure --target=arm-apple-darwin11 --prefix=/usr
$make
$make install
}}}

<font color="red"> If you use a different prefix, you should linke all "arm-apple-darwin11-`*`" to /usr/bin, otherwise clang can not find proper assembler and linker.  

Since there is no file conflicts with system files, /usr as a prefix should be your first choice.

==<font color="blue"> Step 3: The iPhoneOS SDK. </font>==

You can use the pre-generated SDKs (with Arc support, header positions fixed).

for iOS 4.x: http://ios-toolchain-based-on-clang-for-linux.googlecode.com/files/iPhoneOS4.2.sdk.tar.xz

for iOS 5.x: http://ios-toolchain-based-on-clang-for-linux.googlecode.com/files/iPhoneOS5.0.sdk.tar.xz

for iOS 6.x: http://ios-toolchain-based-on-clang-for-linux.googlecode.com/files/iPhoneOS6.0.sdk.tar.xz

Extract it to */usr/share"
{{{
$tar xvf iPhoneOS*.sdk.tar.xz -C /usr/share
}}}

or follow <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ios-toolchain-based-on-clang-for-linux/wiki/iphoneos_sdk_en">this link</a> to generate it by yourself.

for iOS 4.x, you may need pass "-arch armv6" arg to compilers.


==<font color="blue"> Step 4: The utilities </font>==
iPhoneSDK-utils provides below utilities:

  # *ldid* : Codesign tool, with armv7/armv7s support and other changes from orig version.
  # *Clang wrapper* : ios-clang, ios-clang++ to automatically find SDK and construct proper compilation args.
  # *proj2make* : convert xcodeproj to proper Makefiles.
  # *fixpng* : fix png files optimized by iOS.
  # *ios-createProject* : project templates
  # *ios-genLocalization* : localize iOS app easily.

Download from: http://ios-toolchain-based-on-clang-for-linux.googlecode.com/files/iPhoneSDK-utils-0.5.tar.gz

Build and install it:
{{{	
$./configure --prefix=/usr
$make
$make install
}}}


==<font color="blue"> Build app for iOS. </font>==
run ios-createProject
{{{
$ios-createProject
}}}

You will get messages like this:
{{{
iPhone Project Createor
---------------------------
[0.] Application
[1.] Command line utility
[2.] Notification Center widget
[3.] Example Player
[4.] Example UICatalog
Choose a Template:
}}}

then input 0 and the Project name "HelloWorld" to create a helloworld App, enter HelloWorld folder

run:
{{{
$make
$make install IPHONE_IP=<your own device IP>
}}}

If you want to make a localized App, run ios-genLocalization in project folder:

A patch to fix this problem had been provided in <a href = "http://code.google.com/p/ios-toolchain-based-on-clang-for-linux/wiki/build_clang_en"> "Build clang from scratch" </a> Section.

==<font color="blue"> the iOS API documents.(Optional) </font>==
Download API files from:http://devimages.apple.com/docsets/20120109/com.apple.adc.documentation.AppleiOS5_0.iOSLibrary.xar

Extract it:
